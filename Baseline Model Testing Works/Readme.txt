In this section the code is from the baseline model of BanglaOCR. in the last section we tried to implement a Test functions. which runs fine but somehow cannot give correct prediction.

how to run the code :
1) set all the paths correctly
2) check if train and test both function calls are commented out
3) Run the Code.
